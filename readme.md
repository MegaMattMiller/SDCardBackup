# SD Card Backup Utility

As the Photography Department Director for a number of conventions, I have on occasion had issues with staff members disappearing after conventions, or their photos being lost or corrupted. As such, a need was identified to have a backup of photos from all staff before leaving con. That way, if something happens to a staff member or their photos, the organization still has a copy to deliver to attendees.

Such a solution had a number of requirements that made any existing product I found on the market not fit my needs. Namely, it must be standalone, not requiring the use of a laptop or phone in any way, must be made by a company that still exists, and must not be crazy expensive. No commercial product that fit these needs was found, thus a homebrew solution was developed.

This SD Card Backup Utility was created to fill that purpose. It is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with a small built in screen. By connecting a card reader and external HDD/SSD to the Pi, you just need to plug in the card and run the script, and all photos on the card will be copied over

This readme will guide you through setting up the SD Card Backup Utility, however it assumes a basic knowledge of Raspberry Pi and Linux.
